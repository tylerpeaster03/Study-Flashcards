What library needs to be called for functions such as cout, cin, etc?
#include <iostream>
Without any namespaces used, would || cout << "Hello World!"; || cause any errors?
Yes, as without any declared namespaces, you would need to type || std::cout<< "Hellow World!"; ||
Is || system("cls"); || recommended to clear the user's screen?
No, as || system("cls"); || calls an external windows program, which is a security risk!
What is the main difference in arrays and vectors?
Arrays have a set limit declared by the programmer, whilst vectors have no limit, instead being extended via .push_back commands.
How many arrays or vectors can you have in a single program?
As many as needed!
